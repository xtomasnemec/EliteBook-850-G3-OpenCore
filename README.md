# OpenCore config for EliteBook 850 G3

## **This Repo is made only for this exact model and may not work on other models! (HP Elite Book 850 G3(2016 Skylake))**

This config is based on **Dortania's OpenCore** 0.9.2 [GitHub](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).

**This is NOT a guide. There is an oficial [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)**

## Everything works unless stated below
1.   **Functions**
     - Fingerprint reader
     - Some LEDs
     - 
     - **iServices** (ie. iMessage, FaceTime) but you need to fix it yourself [Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html)
> [!WARNING]
> DO THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK
